- Uploaded bytes
- Downloaded bytes



# Building

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

# Running
## Directory structure

You should build your tls proxy using `$ cargo build --release`

And copy `target/release/tlsproxy` to a separate folder.

In the same folder, you should also copy the following files:

- static/
- config.yaml
- log4rs.yaml

If you want to enable TLS, please create your `server.pem`, `server.key` and `ca.pem`.

You may refer to https://github.com/wushilin/minica for cert management.

## Prepare configuration

Example config.yaml
```yaml
listeners:
  HTTPS:
    bind: 0.0.0.0:1443  # TLS proxy binds to 0.0.0.0:1443
    target_port: 443  # Proxy all requests to port 443
    policy: DENY  # If rules matched, they will be denied (possible values: ALLOW|DENY). basically the rules is blacklist. If it is ALLOW, it would act as a whitelist
    rules:
      static_hosts: []  # Static host matching, ignore case
      patterns:
      - ^www.g.*$  # Regex checking, case sensitive. You probably want to add (?i) if you want to ignore case...
    max_idle_time_ms: 3600000
    speed_limit: 0.0 # Speed limit for each connection. 0 is no limit. unit is bytes/second, shared by upload/download together
options:
  log_config_file: log4rs.yaml  # log4rs config
  self_ips:
  - 127.0.0.1  # If target server resolves to this host it will be rejected
  - me.jungle # If target server resolves to one of the addresses by this domain, it will be rejected
dns:
  home.wushilin.net: 192.168.44.100 # DNS override. If target host is home.wushilin.net, it would be resolved as 192.168.44.100. The DNS can be domain to domain redirection as well. e.g. you can use www.google.com as resolve result
admin_server:
  bind_address: 0.0.0.0  # Admin server bind to this address
  bind_port: 48889 # Admin server bind to this port
  username: admin # Admin server requires the basic user
  password: pass1234 # Admin server require the basic password
  tls_cert: null # TLS cert for admin server, required if tls => true
  tls_key: null # TLS key for admin server, required if tls => true
  tls_ca_cert: null # TLS CA cert for admin server, required if tls => true 
  mutual_tls: null # Enable mtls or not true|false|null. If set to true, tls must also be true!
  tls: false # Enable TLS or not
  rocket_log_level: critical # Rocket log level

```

Sample log4rs.yaml
```yaml
refresh_rate: 60 seconds

appenders:
  stdout:
    kind: console
  default:
    kind: rolling_file
    path: "tlsproxy.log"
    append: true
    encoder:
      pattern: "{d(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%.3f %Z)} {M} {({l}):5.5} {f}:{L} - {m}{n}"
    policy:
      kind: compound
      trigger:
        kind: size
        limit: 10 mb
      roller:
        kind: fixed_window
        pattern: "tlsproxy.{}.log.gz"
        count: 20
        base: 1
root:
  level: info
  appenders:
    - default
    - stdout

loggers:
  tlsproxy:
    level: info
    appenders:
      - default
      - stdout
    additive: false
```

Sample systemd unit file
```yaml
[Unit]
Description=The TLS Proxy
After=syslog.target network-online.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target
Wants=network-online.target
        
[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/services/tlsproxy
PIDFile=/opt/services/tlsproxy/tlsproxy.pid

# ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true
        
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Start

Just run the tlsproxy. No argument required. All support files must be in the same folder

Visit your server at http://host:48889 to start managing.

If prompted for Basic auth, please enter the username and password
